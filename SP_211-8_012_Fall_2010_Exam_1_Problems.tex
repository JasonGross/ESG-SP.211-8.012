\section{Problem \thesection\space(30 Points)}
  A car is driving through a green light at $t = 0$ located at $x = 0$ with an initial speed $v_{c, 0} = \SI{12}{\meter\per\second}$.  The acceleration of the car as a function of time is given by
  $$a_c = \begin{cases}
            0 & \text{if }0 < t < t_1 = \SI{1}{\second} \\
            -(\SI{6}{\meter\per\second\cubed})(t - t_1) & \text{if }\SI{1}{\second} < t < t_2
          \end{cases}
  .$$
  A bicycle rider is riding at a constant speed of $v_{b,0}$ and at $t = 0$ is \SI{17}{\meter} behind the car.  The bicyclist reaches the car when the car just comes to rest at time $t_2$.

  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Find the time $t_2$ that the car has just come to rest.
    \item Find the speed of the bicycle.
  \end{enumerate}
\section{Problem \thesection\space(30 Points)}
  Two blocks with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ such that $m_1 \ll m_2$ are connected by a massless inextensible string and a massless pulley as shown in the figure below.  The pulley is rigidly connected to the top of a wedge with angle $\theta$.  The coefficient of friction between the blocks is $\mu$.  The surface between the lower block and the wedge is frictionless.  What are the magnitudes of the acceleration of the two blocks?

\section{Problem \thesection\space(30 Points)}
  A U-control airplane of mass $M$ is attached by a wire of length $L$ and negligible mass to the ``pilot'' who controls the ``lift'' provided by the wing, the force that is normal to the plane of the wings keeping the plane aloft and hence in a direction perpendicular to the wire.  The plane's engine keeps it moving at constant speed $v$.  The wire and the wings of the plane make an angle $\theta$ with the ground.  The gravitational acceleration is $g$.  Express your answers to the following questions in terms of $M$, $g$, $L$, $v$, and $\theta$ as needed.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Find the tension $T$ in the wire when the plane is flown overhead in a circle.
    \item Find a condition that the speed of the plane must satisfy such that, for all values of $\theta$, the tension in the string is not zero. (\textsc{Note}: Your condition should \emph{not} depend on $\theta$.)
    \item Find the magnitude of the ``lift'', the force that is normal to the plane of the wings keeping the plane aloft.
    \item Based on your result form part (c), is $\theta = \pi / 2$ possible?
  \end{enumerate}
