  The Eureka Hovercraft Corporation wanted to hold hovercraft races as an advertising stunt. The hovercraft supports itself by blowing air downward, and has a big fixed propeller on the top deck for forward propulsion. Unfortunately it has no steering equipment, so that pilots found that making high speed turns was very difficult. The company decided to overcome this problem by designing a bowl shaped track in which the hovercraft, once up to speed, would coast along in a circular path with no need to steer. They hired an engineer to design and build the track, and when he finished, he hastily left the country. When the company held their first race, they found to their dismay that the craft took exactly the same time $T$ to circle the track, no matter what speed.
  \begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item Explain why the time is independent of the speed.
    \item Find the equation for the height of the cross section of the bowl in terms of the period to complete one revolution $T$.
  \end{enumerate}
