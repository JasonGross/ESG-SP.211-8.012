  Halley's comet is in an elliptic orbit about the sun. The eccentricity of the orbit is $\varepsilon = 0.967$ and the period is $T = 76$ y. The mass of the sun is $m_s = 1.99 \cdot 10^{30}$ kg.  The mass of Halley's comet is negligible compared to the sun.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Using this data, determine the distance of Halley's comet at closest approach to the sun, perihelion, and furthest distance from the sun, aphelion.
    \item What is the speed of Halley's comet when it is closest to the sun?
  \end{enumerate}
