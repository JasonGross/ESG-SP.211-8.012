\section{Problem \thesection: K\&K 6.24}
  A drum $A$ of mass $m$ and radius $R$ is suspended from a drum $B$ also of mass $m$ and radius $R$, which is free to rotate about its axis. The suspension is in the form of a massless metal tape wound around the outside of each drum, and free to unwind. Gravity is directed downwards. Both drums are initially at rest. Find the initial acceleration of drum $A$, assuming that it moves straight down.

  A hockey puck of mass $m_1$ slides along ice with a velocity $v_0$ and strikes one end of a stick lying on the ice of length $l_2$ and mass $m_2$. The center of mass of the stick moves with an unknown magnitude $v_{cm}$. The stick also rotates about the center of mass with unknown angular velocity $\omega_{f}$. The puck continues to move in the same straight line as before it hit the stick with velocity $v_f$. Assume the ice is frictionless and there is no loss of mechanical energy during the collision.

\section{Problem \thesection: K\&K 6.41}
  A plank of length $2 l$ leans against a wall. The mass of the plank is m which is uniformly distributed. The plank is initially inclined at an angle $\theta$ with respect to the horizontal. It starts to slip downward without friction.
  \begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{ps09_7}\end{center}
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Draw a force diagrams showing all the forces acting on the plank. What is the condition that the plank just starts to slip from the wall.
    \item Is the mechanical energy of the plank conserved as it slips down the wall?
    \item What equations arise from the conditions for static equilibrium for both forces and torque? Think about which point to compute the torque about.
    \item Show that the top of the plank loses contact with the wall when it is two-thirds of its initial height against the wall. Hint: only a single variable and its derivatives are needed to describe the motion of the system. Consider the motion of the center of mass of the plank.
