\subsection*{Problem}
  A device called a capstan is used aboard ships in order to control a rope which is under great tension. The rope is wrapped around a fixed drum, usually for several turns (the drawing shows about three fourths turn). The load on the rope pulls it with a force $T_A$, and the sailor holds it with a much smaller force $T_B$.  Can you show that $T_B = T_Ae^{-\mu_s\theta}$, where $\mu_s$ is the coefficient of static friction and $\theta$ is the total angle subtended by the rope on the drum?
